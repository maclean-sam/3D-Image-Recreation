##### How do I approach designing software?

Designing the software for my OpenGL project involved making use of the GLEW, GLM, GLFW, and GLAD libraries. These libraries helped me be successful in my approach by providing me with a framework for reading user input, performing operations on vertex array objects, and loading extensions. The design skills I used included replicating the scene as closely as possible to the image that was being constructed and taking into account the functions/methods available to me in aiding my design. I started by drawing the primitive shapes for each object to get the basic structure down before performing binds and adding textures/lighting using the shader program. After that, I was able to translate, rotate, and scale the objects according to taste while being able to create an orthographic projection. These design tactics will be used in my future work where I am either designing visual components or writing similar code.

##### How do I approach developing programs?

Developing the program involved many problem-solving techniques to achieve the desired end goal. I tested my program as I was coding to make sure it functions as intended and the objects are where they need to be. I had identical objects used for one of my items so I used the same vertices to construct two boxes and then translated them to where they needed to go. Iteration should be used when possible to create a more efficient program with less code while remaining well structured. Developing the project throughout the milestones helped me take different steps instead of tackling the project all at once. It was nice to learn one aspect of OpenGL at a time which allowed me to explore the functions that it has to offer before moving on to the next aspect of the program. 


##### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science helps me reach my goals by aiding my abilities to create efficient and well-constructed programs that provide the best user experience possible. Since I am pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science, computational graphics and visualizations gave me additional knowledge about aspects of computer programming that I had not explored before. Professionally, I hope to become a software engineer which includes programming with languages like C++ so having a good grasp on the language and additional knowledge of OpenGL will help me become successful in my future career.
